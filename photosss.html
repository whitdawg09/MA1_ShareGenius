    <h2> The Plane Crash</h2>

    <p>
   During the 8th season of Grey's Anatomy, several characters were on a plane to go to another hospital and got into a plane crash. This one episode changed the entire rest of the show. Two of my favorite characters died, one lost her leg and the rest were also hurt. The reprecussions of this event are visible still now in the 22nd season.
   <br>
   <br>
   This is one of my least favorite episodes, because as I said before two of my favorite characters died. Everyone else on the show who lived had close relationships to these characters and for so long after these deaths affected them.
   <br>
   <br>
   I think this is an important episode in the show because it is a point where a lot of new characters come. After Lexie and Mark die, Teddy, Owen, and Maggie all come and they add a lot to the show.
<br>
<br>
This is when the show started to go downhill because some characters left, they had to bring in the new ones, but new characters could never be better then the originals for me.
